currently working on "merger" 

* TODO write the "scattered B-matrix merger" 
- merge_test directory at Ellington. 
** outline of the process 
- a) 0 - 5k, with test3 (absolute feature index, no row index)  
- b) 0 - 5k, with calc_B_st.rb ---> recover_test ---> concur to a) 
- c) 0-1k, 1k-4k, 4k-5k, with calcB_st.rb ---> merger --> recover_test --> a) 
** Making test files 
*** TODO (running) 5k with test3 (pool02) 
*** DONE (running) 5k with calc_B_st.rb
*** DONE scattered run on pool. (c) 
** outline of a merger 
- many .out files in, list out first-last, work only when no gap(? yea, so) 
- previous step resulted "order" of files (or, just sorted list would be enough, if they have "ordered" sequence. --- add one more 0 in number out) 
- call Simple merger (File_with_row_index.rb) with the ordered list. It handles and outputs as one file. 
*** TODO add one more 0 at file name, at calc_B_st (for full scale run) 
** Write merger 
- (Any memo) 
** Write "recoverer" 
- read line-indexed matrix with relative index; 
- outputs absolute indexed; (mostly already done with test5, I guess...)

* Hadoop / GridEngine? 
*** TODO how to force/limit usage of slots per computer (qsub) 

*** TODO check basic Hadoop. -- why not run just a Hadoop stream? 


* TODO small scale test on pool pc & grid server 
** single-thread B-maker
*** DONE spin off real worker, single thread. 
- calc_B_st.rb (calculation, B matrix, single thread) 

** Pool check: 
*** TODO run a set of numbers and check their time. 
- 100: 892, 445, 1338 (pool2) 
- 1000: 891, 5030, 5921 (pool3) 
- 10k: 

** Grid check: how much does it takes
*** TODO run a set of numbers and check their time. 
- 100: 2310, 762, 3073 (node25) 
- 1000: 2429, 10451, 12881 (node26) 
- 10k: 2290, running ... node27 

** Time estimation? 
(/ 3000000 10000) 300 10k pieces? 
(/ 3000000 5000) 600 5k peices? 




* DONE Test4 - multi-threaded B-matrix generator. use 3c + thread. 


* DONE Run Smaller Example, full cycle. 
** DONE make test3 output, test3c output. 
** DONE complete test5 (relative index -> absolute index) 
** DONE use test5 to make test3c output in the same format to test3. confirm all equal.   


* Test3 
** DONE make smaller example for future work on air, westy, etc. 
** DONE finish test3c: check identical output to test3b  
   

* DONE Test5 
- checking that relative values can be retrieved equivalent to...
