-some memo about "one big file" approach of B-matrix 

* Basic idea
- one big file, with row (line) index. 
- The file wrapper is written in File_with_row_index.rb 

* Size estimation 
** test3 uses index:value format 
0-10: 5184130 bytes (5Mbytes) 

** test3b uses index_delta:value in text format. 
0-10: 3269409 bytes (3Mbytes) 

** Total (in estimation) 
- We have 3M features (rows of B matrix) 
- (* (/ 3.0 10) 3000000) = 900,000 M  

900 G? only that? 

10: 3M
100: 30M
1000: 300M
10,000: 3G 
100,000: 30G 
1,000,000: 300G 
3,000,000: 900G 

So about 1 T only? That's ... interesting. 
Maybe first 0-10 was very sparse. Let's try 0-100 or 0-1000. 
Okay. 0-1000 first. 

** 0-1000, for better estimation
